The control system listens for user commands on port 8080.
All commands are sent as plain text over UDP.

The available commands are split into three catagories: drive commands, pan commands,
and sense commands. Once a command is received, the associated action is continued until
another command of the same category is received, with the exception of sense commands,
which are executed once per request.

Commands that are not listed in the API are ignored.

- Drive commands -
  DRIVE [theta] [throttle_speed]
    Sets the drive direction and speed of the machine, where theta is the direction value in degrees, represented as a
    string.
    Changing theta is analogus to adjusting a steering wheel.
    throttle_speed is a 16-bit unsigned integer corresponding to the movement speed of the device, encoded in ASCII.

    For example, sending the command "DRIVE 0 65" will cause the machine to move forward at 65/65536 the maximum speed.
    The command "DRIVE 45 65536" will cause the machine to bank left at maximum speed.

- Pan Commands -
  PAN [X] [Y]
      Sets the camera position, where X is the horizontal position in degrees and Y is the vertical position in degrees. 90
      degrees is the middle position of both axies.

      For example, sending the command "PAN 90 90" will cause the camera to point directly forward.
      "PAN 0 90" Will cause the camera to move to it's rightmost extreme.
      "PAN 90 0" Will cause the camera to angle down to it's lowest extreme.

- Sense Commands -
  SENSE_LIST
    Invokes the machine to send a list of available sensors and their associated ids and data return types to the client machine.
    The list is sent as plain text over UDP with one sensor listing per line.
    The list is terminated with a NULL character.

    The available data return types are as follows:

    -ushort: A 16-bit unsigned integer
    -short: A 16-bit signed integer
    - uint: A 32-bit unsigned integer
    -int: A 32-bit signed integer
    - ulong: An unsigned 64-bit integer
    -long: A signed 64-bit integer
    -float: A 32-bit floating point number
    -double: A 64-bit floating point number

    A sensor may return multiple data points. For example, a gyroscope may return 3 floating point numbers 

    An example response would be:

    accelorometer 0 ushort
    gyro 1 float float float
    barometer 2 uint
    altimeter 3 ulong
    thermistor 4 short
    
  SENSE_GET [sense_id]
    Causes the machine to send a sensor sample back to the client machine, where sense_id is the sensor's id
    code listed by SENSE_LIST. The return value will be of the form listed by SENSE_LIST. For example, if a return type
    ushort is listed, the SENSE_GET response for that sensor will be 2 bytes in length.
