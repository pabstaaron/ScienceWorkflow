The control system listens for user commands on port 8080.
All commands should be sent as plain text over UDP.

The available commands are split into three catagories: drive commands, pan commands,
and sense commands. Once a command is received, the associated action is continued until
another command of the same category is received, with the exception of sense commands,
which are executed once per request.

Commands that are not listed in the API are ignored.

- Drive commands -
  DRIVE [theta] [throttle_speed]
    Sets the drive direction and speed of the machine, where theta is the direction value in degrees, represented by
    two bytes or ASCII characters. (zero coresponds to 0 degrees and 0xFFFF coresponds to 359 degrees).
    Changing theta is analogus to adjusting a steering wheel.
    throttle_speed is a 16-bit unsigned integer corresponding to the movement speed of the device, encoded in ASCII.

    For example, sending the command "DRIVE [NULL][NULL] [NULL]A" will cause the machine to move forward at 65/4096 the maximum speed.
    The command "DRIVE [NULL]- [0xFF][0xFF]" will cause the machine to bank left at maximum speed.

- Pan Commands -
  PAN [theta] [pan_speed]

- Sense Commands -
  SENSE_LIST
    Causes the machine to send a list of available sensors and their associated ids and data return types to the client machine.
    The list is sent as plain text over UDP with one sensor listing per line.
    The list is terminated with a NULL character.

    An example response would be:

    accelorometer 0 ushort
    gyro 1 float float float
    barometer 2 uint
    altimeter 3 ulong
    thermistor 4 short
    [NULL]
    
  SENSE_GET [sense_id]
    Causes the machine to send a sensor sample back to the client machine, where sense_id is the sensor's id
    code listed by SENSE_LIST. The return value will be of the form listed by SENSE_LIST. For example, if a return type
    ushort is listed, the SENSE_GET response for that sensor will be 2 bytes in length.
