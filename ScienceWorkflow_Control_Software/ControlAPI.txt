The control system listens for user commands on port 8080.
All commands should be sent as plain text over UDP.

The available commands are split into three catagories: drive commands, pan commands,
and sense commands. Once a command is received, the associated action is continued until
another command of the same category is received, with the exception of sense commands,
which are executed once per request.

Commands that are not listed in the API are ignored.

- Drive commands -
  DRIVE [theta]
    Sets the drive direction of the machine, where theta is the direction value in degrees, represented by
    two bytes or ASCII characters. (zero coresponds to 0 degrees and 0xFFFF coresponds to 359 degrees).
    This command is analogus to adjusting a steering wheel
  DRIVE_THROTTLE [drive_speed]:
    Sets the throttle speed to drive_speed, where drive_speed is a 16-bit unsigned integer, encoded
    in ASCII (string values will not be be parsed). For example, "DRIVE_THROTTLE A' would correspond
    to a throttle speed of 65.
    This command does not override a direction command.
    This command is analogus to adjusting an accelorator.

- Pan Commands -
  PAN_DIR [theta]
  PAN_SPEED [pan_speed]

- Sense Commands -
  SENSE_LIST
  SENSE_GET [sense_id]
